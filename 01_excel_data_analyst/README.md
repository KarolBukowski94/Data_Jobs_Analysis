# Data Job Postings Dashboards (2023–2025) — Excel

This folder contains two Excel dashboards built on **real-world data job postings (2023–2025)**. The projects demonstrate progression from **formula-driven dashboarding** ([salary_dashboard.xlsx](01_salary_dashboard/salary_dashboard.xlsx)) to a more scalable approach using **Power Query + Power Pivot + DAX** ([skill_analysis.xlsx](02_skill_analysis/skill_analysis.xlsx)), with the goal of turning job market data into clear, actionable insights.

For dataset scope, shared definitions, and course resources, see the [main README](../README.md).
