# Data Job Postings Dashboards (2023–2025) — Power BI

This repository contains two Power BI dashboards built on **real-world data job postings**. The projects demonstrate progression from **foundational reporting** (V1: multi-page exploration + drill-through) to a more **focused analytical design** (V2: single-page, DAX-driven view), with the goal of turning job market data into clear, actionable insights.

For dataset scope, shared definitions, and course resources, see the [main README](../README.md).
